			<p>Muslims in the area are believed to be chiefly Ashrafs and are said to be descendants of Muslims who invaded Bengal in the 14th century. There is a tradition that the Bagdi king who ruled here was defeated by Hazrat Shah Kabir Halibi and Hazrat Karamuddin, both of whom were killed in the battle. Their tombs are revered to this day by both Hindus and Muslims.
</p>
<p>Furfura Sharif contains the Mazaar Sharif (Tomb) of Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique and his five sons, popularly known as the 'Panch Huzur Keblah (Rah.)]'. Thousands of people from all over India come to visit their tombs every day.
</p>
	<p>Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique(Rah.) was born in 1846 in Furfura-Sharif. He was a direct descendant of the first Khalif of Islam, Syedena Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddique(Rad.).Coincidentally he bore the same name. He was a social and religious reformer, so he was also known as 'Mujaddid-e-Zaman'. He founded many charitable institutes, orphanages and free health center. He was also a great educationist who realized that it is through education he can free the society of all evils and so he founded several madrasas, schools and learning centers. In Furfura Sharif he established Madrasa, along with free boarding facilities for the underprivileged students. He encouraged female education by establishing a School for girls in Furfura Sharif named "Siddiqua High School". His contributions were recognized by several historians and literati. A journal, “The Muslim Digest”, published from Durban in South Africa, acknowledges him as an “illustrious, religious leader- fearless, God intoxicated and selfless as a preacher, he would never attack other religions.... and endeared himself to people from other communities and castes”. He was a great patriot and was involved in the freedom struggle of India.
</p>
		<p>He was the founder of the "Order Of Furfura Sharif" or "Silsila-e-Furfura Sharif". He belonged to the Ahle-Sunnat-Wal-Jamaat school of thoughts. He was also the founder of the religious congregation, which is still observed on the 21st 22nd and 23rd of Falgun Bengali month (Approx 5th, 6th & 7 March) every year by his grandsons. He did not prefer calling this congregation a "Urs" but rather prefer it being called "Isale-Sawab".
